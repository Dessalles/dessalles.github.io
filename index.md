## Presentation

I'm PhD researcher at [MaIAGE](http://maiage.jouy.inra.fr/) (INRA — Jouy-en-Josas — France) and currently a visiting researcher at the laboratory of [Biomathematics of UCLA](http://biomath.ucla.edu/). I'm currently working on the modeling of the immune responses to antigens. My main interested consist in mathematical and computational modeling applied to biology, using mainly (but not exclusively) stochastic models. During my PhD in applied mathematics at INRA and INRIA (France), I worked on the stochastic modeling of protein production inside bacteria. My main skills consist of the analysis of stochastic and deterministic models and the use of several computational language (Python, C++, Matlab, Julia) for simulations.

Look at my [Resume](./CV_Dessalles.pdf).

## Also…

During my spare time, I'm an editor of the online Magazine [Kinea](http://kinea.media): a plurilingual magazine showing proposing rigorous political and economical analyses but also natural, social and human science popularization.

I also program open source softwares such as [AthenaWriter](https://github.com/grumpfou/AthenaWriter), a short stories word processor.
